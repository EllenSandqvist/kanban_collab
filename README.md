- The app isnt responsive, a task can be to make the app more responsive on each site

## functionality

Our kanban board works with 3 layers of redux, tasks, columns and users. These are all stored in the localstorage as well so when a page reloads, the user still has access to their data. We have decided to always have 1 user logged in as a "active user", you can swap active users by clicking on other portraits. They can use the setting page to make their board more personolized. Each column can be renamed and multiple columns can be created and columns can be removed. Tasks can be dragged to each column but also have a dropdown menu to assigned them from their to other columns.
